# Reader's Logbook (Work in Progress)
This is a capstone project for a Udemy course called The Complete Web Development Bootcamp 2023 (by The App Brewery).

**The project is currently under development.**

These following was copied from the project instructions: 

### Overview
I read a lot of books but after I finish reading them I often don't remember all the most salient parts of the book. So I started taking notes. This capstone project is built on this idea. My friend Derek Sivers has this fantastic website where he has all the non-fiction books he has read, his notes, his ratings and when he read them. The books are sortable by rating, recency and title. It's a such cool idea for a project so I'm including it as a capstone here in this course.

### Objectives
Revise how to integrate public APIs into web projects.

Gain more experience using Express/Node.js for server-side programming.

Demonstrate ability to Create Read Update and Delete data in a PostgreSQL Database to persist data.
